### Oh hello there 👋

I'm Adrienne!  

I’m Front End Developer based out of Hamilton, Ontario 🇨🇦 with a background in sustainability and non-profit management. I love being able to bridge creativity and tech to build dynamic and meaningful web applications.

My tech stack includes HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, and React, as well as experience with REST APIs, version control (Git) and Firebase.

- 🎬 I’m currently working on a site for a commercial film director.
- 🛍 I’m currently learning Shopify's API docs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something meaningful!  Feel free to reach out to me if you are a community-led org or non-profit and need some support!
