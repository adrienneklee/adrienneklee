### Oh hello there 👋

I'm Adrienne!  

I’m Front End Developer based out of Hamilton, Ontario 🇨🇦 with a background in sustainability and non-profit management. I love being able to bridge creativity and tech to build dynamic and meaningful web applications.

My tech stack includes HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, and React, as well as experience with REST APIs, version control (Git) and Firebase. I've also been dipping my toes in MERN and have been enjoying creating Full Stack Apps.

- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working as the lead Web Developer for Canada's largest progressive creative agency.
- 🧮 I’m currently learning how to write unit and integration tests for backend.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something meaningful!  Feel free to reach out to me if you are a community-led org or non-profit and need some support!
