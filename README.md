### Oh hello there 👋

I'm Adrienne!  

I’m a Technical Product Manager and Front End Developer based out of Hamilton, Ontario 🇨🇦 with a background in sustainability and social enterprise development. I love being able to bridge creativity and tech to build dynamic and meaningful web applications.

My tech stack includes JavaScript (ES6), React, Ruby on Rails, as well as experience with REST APIs, version control (Git) and Firebase. I've also been dipping my toes in MERN and have been enjoying creating Full Stack Apps.

- 👩🏻‍💻 I spent the last 3.5 years as a Technical Product Manager and in-house Developer for Canada's first unionized agency. I am currently open to new opportunities.
- 🧮 I’m currently learning how to write unit and integration tests for backend.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something meaningful!  Feel free to reach out to me if you are a community-led org or non-profit and need some support!
